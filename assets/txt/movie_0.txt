          EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - BROILING HOT DAY

          As the film's OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE plays, complete with its own
          SPAGHETTI WESTERN THEME SONG, we see SEVEN shirtless and shoeless
          BLACK MALE SLAVES connected together with LEG IRONS, being run,
          by TWO: WHITE MALE HILLBILLIES on HORSEBACK.

          The location is somewhere in Texas. The Black Men (ROY, BIG SID,
          BENJAMIN, DJANGO, PUDGY RALPH, FRANKLYN, and BLUEBERRY) are slaves just
          recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville
          Mississippi. The White Hillbillies are two Slave Traders called,
          The SPECK BROTHERS (ACE and DICKY).

          One of the seven slaves is our hero DJANGO... . he's fourth in the leg
          iron line. We may or may not notice a tiny small "r" burned into his
          cheek ("r" for runaway), but we can't help but notice his back which
          has been SLASHED TO RIBBONS by Bull Whip Beatings.

          As the Operatic Opening Theme Song plays, we see a MONTAGE of misery
          and pain, as Django and the Other Men are walked through blistering
          sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip. Bare feet
          step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles. Leg Irons take the
          skin off ankles.

          AS The CREDITS play, DJANGO has a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK.
          Now Spaghetti Western Flashbacks are never pretty, it's usually the
          time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most
          painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters
          from his past. In this instance we see Django in a SLAVE PEN at the
          Greenville Auction.

                         DJANGO
          Amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of the
          cell door, his wife BROOMHILDA being led to the auction block.

          He fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the distance,
          he can see Broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the distance he
          hears the Auctioneer yell; "Sold." Then she's taken away to whereabouts
          unknown, never to be seen again.

          As the sun continues to beat down on Django's head, he remembers;

          DJANGO in the SLAVE PEN
          with what seems like a one hundred and fifty Slaves in a cell designed
          for forty.

          WHITE MEN yank him out. of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and lead him
          down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area
          circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the
          structure.

          The ground floor is covered by the BIG MONEY BUYERS who stand in front
          of the auction block.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         2

                         DJANGO
          is moved into a line of SLAVES (The Black Men), and their MASTERS
          (their White Owners), and their SELLERS (the White Man actually doing
          the sales pitch on the auction block), as they wait for their turn on
          the block.
          A SLAVE (ROBBIE), stand on the auction block in view of the room full
          of Buyers, The SELLER sells, and the OWNERS stand off to the side.

                         DJANGO
          takes in the environment around him. Django has never cared for white
          folks, but these white folks are in particularly ugly.

          It's DJANGO's turn ON THE AUCTION BLOCK
          as the THEME SONG wails its tragic crescendo, Django is brought up on
          the auction block. He.looks down at all the WHITE PEOPLE who want to
          buy Niggers, who look up to him.
          His heart fills with poison.

          BACK TO DJANGO
          walking in Leg Irons with his six Other Companions, walking across the
          blistering Texas panhandle... .remembering.. .thinking. - .hating.

          THE OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE
          end.


          /--" EXT - WOODS -- NIGHT

          It's night time and The Speck Brothers, astride HORSES, keep pushing
          their black skinned cargo forward.
          It's a very pitch black night, with only a few stars in the.sky to
          create a little top light. It's so dark, the Slavers use the creek.bed
          to keep from getting lost. Both Speck Brothers carry a lantern up on
          their horse, as. does Roy, the Slave in lead position on the chain gang.
          It's also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven slaves,
          two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air. In fact the
          seven chained together Slaves, with the lead one holding a lantern, and
          all of them chugging out smoky breath, and. slightly moving in unison,
          resemble a human locomotive.
          The Slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs, both Speck
          Brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings, and white
          fur collars.

          WHEN...
          .A SOUND and a SMALL LIGHT appears ahead of them on the road. This
          makes the Slave Traders stop their human live stock, and ready their
          rifles for possible trouble.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         3

          A BLACK HORSE
          carrying a dressed in grey Rider, CLIP-CLOPS from the background to the
          foreground, illuminated by a glowing lantern that the Rider carries.

                         THE RIDER
          appears to be a tenderfoot, due to his style of dress. A long grey
          winter'coat, over a grey three piece business suit, and a grey bowler
          hat on his head.

                         DICKY SPECK
          Who's that stumblin around in the dark?
          State your business, or prepare to get
          winged!

                         THE RIDER
          Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no
          harm. I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
          The Rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front
          of the two Slavers, and their Slaves, lifting the lantern up to his
          face. He speaks with a slight German accent.

                         THE RIDER
          (to the Slavers)
          Good cold evening gentlemen.
          (to the shivering Slaves)
          Good evening-I'm looking for a pair of
          slave traders that go by the'name of
          The Speck Brothers. Might that be you?

                         ACE SPECK
          Who wants to. know?

                         THE RIDER
          I do. I'm Dr. King Schultz, and this
          is my horse, Fritz.
          Fritz, does a little bow with his head, a neat trick the doctor taught
          him.

                         DICKY SPECK
          You a doctor?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Affirmative.

                         DICKY SPECK
          What kinda doctor?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Dentist. Are you The Speck Brothers, and did you
          purchase those men at The Greenville.Slave Auction?

                         ACE SPECK
          So what?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         LE
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So, I wish to parley with you.

                         ACE SPECK
          Speak English!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh, I'm sorry. Please forgive me, it is a
          second language. Amongst your inventory,
          I've been led to believe, is a specimen
          I'm keen to acquire.
          (to the slaves)
          Hello you poor devils. Is there one among
          you, who was formerly a resident of
          The Carrucan Plantation?
          Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second
          half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness. In the darkness a
          VOICE rings out;

          DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
          I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.
          Dr.Schultz moves Fritz forward towards the darkness, raises his
          lantern, illuminating our hero Django.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Splendid! And what's your name young, man?

                         DJANGO
          Django.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Wunderbar! You're exactly the one I'm looking
          for. So tell me Django - by the way that's a
          amazing name - during your time at the
          Carrucan Plantation, did you come to know
          three overseers by the name of The Brittle
          Brothers?
          Django nods his head, yes.
          Dr.Schultz is delighted.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Big John, Ellis, and little brother Raj?

                         DJANGO
          Dem da Brittle Brothers.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So Django, do you think you could recognize -
           . The Speck Brothers have been watching this tenderfoot engage their
          Slave in polite conversation.. .with a touch of disbelief.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ACE SPECK
          Hey, stop talkin' to him like that!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Like what?

                         ACE SPEC
          Like that!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain

                         ACE SPECK
          Speak English, goddamit!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Everybody calm down! I'm simply a customer
          trying to conduct a transaction.

                         ACE SPECK
          I don't care, no sale. Now off wit ya!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Don't be ridiculous, of course they're for
          sale.
          Ace raises his rifle towards the German.

                         ACE SPECK
          Move it!
          Ace cocks back the rifle hammer.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          My good man, did you simply get carried away
          with your dramatic gesture, or are you
          pointing that weapon at me with lethal
          intention...?

                         ACE SPECK
          Last chance, fancy pants
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          - Very well -
           The doctor, throws his lantern to the ground, enveloping him in
          darkness.
          The next FLASH OF LIGHT we see is the good doctors PISTOL out of his
          holster, and FIRING point blank into Ace Specks face...
          .BLOWING the dumber dumb brother off his horse, dead in the dirt.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Before Dicky can maneuver either his rifle or his horse in the Germans
          direction...

          BAM...
          Dr.SCHULTZ SHOOTS his HORSE in the head...
          .The Steed goes down taking Dicky with him...
          When the dead weight horse lands on Dicky's slightly twisted leg, we
          hear TWO DISTINCT CRACKING SOUNDS.:..
          Dicky lets out a bitch like scream.
          The Slaves watch all this. They've never seen a white man kill another
          white man before.
          Dicky is pinned down under his ole paint.
          Django watches in the dark, the German climb down off his horse,
          pick up Ace's discarded lantern, and walk over to the remaining Speck.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Sorry about putting a bullet in your beast.
          But I didn't want you to do anything rash
          before you had a moment to come to your senses.
          Dr.Sch.ultz LIGHTS the lantern, illuminating himself, as he stands over
          Dicky's body.

                         DICKY SPECK
          You goddamn son of a bitch, you killed Ace!
          Dr.SCHULTZ.
          I only shot your brother, once he threatened
          to shoot me. And I do believe I have ...

                         (COUNTING OUT

                         THE SLAVES)
          .one, two, three, four, five, six,
          seven witnesses who can attest to that fact.

                         DICKY SPECK
          My damn legs busted!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No doubt. Now, if you can keep your
          caterwauling down to a minimum, I'd like
          to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.

                         (TO DJANGO)
          As I was saying, if you were to see
          the Brittle Brothers again, would you
          recognize them?

                         DJANGO
          Yes.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Now I'm sure. to you, all unshaven white men
          look alike. So Django, in a crowd of
          unshaven white men, can you honestly
          and positively point out The Brittle Brothers?

          DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
          We're in his little shack at the Carrucan Plantation. It's PISSING RAIN
          outside. Django is making love to his wife Broomhilda, when she stops
          letting out a shout. The three overseers known as THE BRITTLE BROTHERS
          are outside peeking in through the window. They BURST in through the
          front door. Soaked to the bone, they rodeo bull their way into the
          shack, and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement.
          As Django and Broomhilda are forced to copulate, they run their wet
          white hands down her chocolate leg.. .they fondle his ass.. .they squeeze
          her tit. . .they bring a belt across Django's backside to make him fuck
          faster. . .then they yank him off, as BIG JOHN climbs on top of
          Broomhilda..the other Brittle brothers whip Django with their belts,
          and make him sit in the corner, while they finish with his wife.

          BACK TO DJANGO

                         DJANGO
          I can point 'em out.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Sold American! So Mr.Speck, how much for
          Django?

                         DICKY SPECK
          I'm gonna lose this leg!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, unless you find a talented physician
          very quickly, I'm afraid that will be the.
          end result. But back to business, how much
          do you want for Django?

                         DICKY SPECK
          You go to hell!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Don't be silly. How much for Django?

                         DICKY SPECK
          800 dollars!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh come now, I may not have the experience in
          the slave trade that you and your family does,
          but neither was I born yesterday.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         8
          The. good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked
          up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says
          that the going rate for African flesh'
          - in particularly a field nigger -_is sixty
          to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as
          Django is, technically, he is a field. nigger.
          Which according to"this pamphlet here - and
          why would they lie - puts his price at
          eighty dollars. So in light of that, how
          bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for
          young Django here.
          Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a
          one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And since your late brother. won't be using
          it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag.
          He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on
          Dicky's body. He bends down and, puts the paper money-.in the saddle bags
          on Dicky's dead horse. With.his hands in there, he roots around and
          finds the keys to-the leg irons. He unlocks Django's leg irons.
          Django is free.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good
          rubbing, then get up on that horse.
          Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter
          coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
          Django removes the coat from the dead slaver. Puts on the warm jacket
          over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse.
          Dr.Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a
          bill of sale. Do you have one?
          Dicky just curses him.
          He says, removing a notebook from his pocket;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I thought not. No worries, I come prepared.
          (as he writes)
          This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
          (he stops, then
          says to Django)
          Django is spelled with a silent "D",
          is it not?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         9

                         DJANGO
          Huh?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Why not..
          He writes it in his book with a silent "D", then stops to admire the
          way it looks.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, that does add a little character.
          The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down
          under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make your
          mark here.
          The. Hillbilly spits in the German gentleman's face. The good doctor
          wipes his face with a handkerchief. Then takes out a pocket knife.
          And whispers something that can't be heard in the slavers ear.
          He signs the bill of sale.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr.Speck, I would like to say it was a
          pleasure doing business with you, but your
          customer service leaves a lot to be desired.
          The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz, and looks to the six Slaves, in
          leg irons.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Now as to you poor devils.
          He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So as I.see it, when it comes to the subject
          of what to do next, you gentlemen have two
          choices. One, once I'm gone, you lift that
          beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him
          to the nearest town. Which would be at least
          thirty-seven miles back the way you came.
          Or ...
          .Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that
          rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head,
          bury the two of them deep, and make your way
          to a more enlightened area of the country.
          The choice is yours.
          He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds;

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         0
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh, and on the off chance that there's
          any astronomy aficionados amongst you,
          the North Star is THAT ONE. Tata.
          He looks to Django, who doesn't know how to start his horse.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Just give him a little kick.
          Django does, and the horse responds by moving.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          See, it's not so difficult.

          EXT - MORNING TEXAS LANDSCAPE - SUNRISE
          The DAWN BREAKS on a western landscape. The two men ride their horses
          silently, horse hooves CLIP-CLOPPING among the rocks. Django wears
          Specks winter coat, with one of Dr.Schultz's white button down dress
          shirts underneath it. As they ride through the picturesque scene...
          Dr.Schultz breaks the silence.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So, Django, what do you intend to name him?

                         DJANGO
          Who?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Your horse?

                         DJANGO
          What horse?
          Dr.SCHULTZ'
          The horse you're riding.

                         DJANGO
          This ain't my horse.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes it is.

                         DJANGO
          No it ain't, it's your horse. I'm just riding
          it.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well, technically, yes - Wait a minute -
          technically not. If it's my horse, I can
          give it to you, and as of now, I'm doing such.
          Django, you're now the proud owner of a horse,
          congratulations.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         /1

                         DJANGO
          I can't feed no horse. I can't put no horse
          up in no stable.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (FRUSTRATED)
          Don't worry about all that!
          They ride a bit longer in silence.. .the good doctor composes himself...
          then says with a smile;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So... . now that that's settled... . what do you
          intend to name it? Half the fun of having
          a horse is choosing his name. For instance
          my steed is named Fritz. He's stubborn,
          ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but I
          couldn't do without him.
          (he pats Fritz's neck)
          Anyway, the name of one's steed, isn't
          something one does lightly. So once you've
          thought about it for awhile -

                         DJANGO
          - Tony.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          - Tony what?

                         DJANGO
          - I dunno, Tony the horse.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh, you mean you want to name your horse
          Tony?

                         DJANGO
          Yeah. That's what you jus' asked me, right?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          When you're right you're right, indeed I did.
          Why Tony?

                         DJANGO
          I gotta tell ya? You didn't tell me I gotta
          tell ya.
          As they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a
          western town. They pass by a sign that says; "WELCOME TO DAUGHTREY,

                         TEXAS"

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         /Z
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well I'm naturally curious, of course, but
          there's no reason you MUST tell me. In fact
          an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to
          any steed. And I do believe Tony wears it
          well. Good job Django, well done.

          EXT - THE WESTERN TOWN OF DAUGHTREY - MORNING
          As the citizens of Daughtrey wake up, Django and Dr.Schultz ride Fritz
          and Tony through the main street of town..Daughtrey looks like a
          million western towns we've seen before in movies. But to the
          TOWNSPEOPLE of Daughtrey, Django and the German don't look like a
          million other visitors.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What's everybody staring at?

                         DJANGO
          They never seen a nigger on a horse before.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What's this bizarre obsession they have
          with. you not riding horses?

                         DJANGO
          You askin' me?
          Dr.Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts. Django has
          a little trouble both stopping Tony and getting off him, but it gets
          done. Dr.Schultz keeps bombarding The Slave with questions.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So what other archaic rituals are you people
          verboten to take part in?
          As per usual with this white man, Django thinks; "What"?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm just trying to get a clear idea on what
          you can do, and what you can't do, and if
          you can't do it, why can't you do it?
          Like for instance, what if we were to walk
          in this saloon here, sit down at a table,
          order a drink, and drink it?
          Would the authorities frown on that?

                         DJANGO
          Hell yeah, they gonna frown.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What part would they find the most offensive?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         13

                         DJANGO
          All of it. I can't be walkin' in no saloon.
          I can't be sittin' my ass on no chair,
          at no table. I can't be drinkin' no drink.
          And I definitely can't be sharin' no drink,
          with no white man, in public.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So if you and I did those things, that would
          be considered enough of a infraction to make
          the saloon keeper go get the sheriff?

                         DJANGO
          You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff.
          The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well in that case Django, after you.

                         DJANGO
          Whoa - I ain't funnin, I can't go in there.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Django you're going to have to learn to trust
          me, and as the man said; "There's no time
          like the,present."
          He takes Django by the arm and leads him into the entryway of the
          establishment.

          INT - SALOON - MORNING
          The nervous black slave and the confident German'dentist walk into the
          saloon.
          The SALOON KEEPER (PETE) is high up on a chair placed high up on a
          table, to change a candle in the saloons chandelier. His back is turned
          away from the two patrons.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Good morning inn keeper, two beers for two
          weary travelers.

                         SALOON KEEPER
          It',s still pretty early, we won't be open
          for about a hour. But by then we'll be
          servin' breakfast -
          He turns around and sees them.

                         SALOON KEEPER
          Whoa! What the hell you think you doin' boy,
          get that nigger outta here.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         IT

                         TIME CUT

          EXT - SALOON - MORNING
          It's about five minutes later, and the Saloon Keeper comes running out
          of the bar to get the Sheriff.
          When Dr.Schultz, sitting at a table with the young Django, calls;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Inn keeper! Remember, get the sheriff, not
          the marshall. This wouldn't be the marshalls
          jurisdiction.'This is just a infraction,
          on what I assume is a simple county ordinance,
          and that would fall under the domain of the
          Sheriff.
          The Saloon Keeper runs away.
          The two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It looks like we must act as our own bartender.
          The German stands up, and walks-behind the bar, and pours two beer's
          from the tap into mugs. Django remains seated, and after a beat, asks;

                         DJANGO
          What kinda dentist are you?
          This makes the doctor laugh, as he pours the beer's.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I haven't practiced dentistry in five years -
          Not to say once I know you better, I wouldn't
          like to get a look at that mouth - I'm sure
          it's a disaster - But these days I practice
          a new profession ... . Bounty Hunter.
          This gets no reaction from Django.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is?
          The Black Man shakes his head, no.
          As the good doctor, walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer,

                         HE EXPLAINS;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well the way the slave trade deals in
          human lives for cash, a bounty hunter,
          deals in corpses.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         15
          Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
          The state places a bounty on a man's head.
          I track that man, I find that man, I kill
          that man. After I've killed him, I transport
          that man's corpse back to the authorities -
          and sometimes that's easier said then done.
          I show that corpse to the authorities -
          proving, yes indeed, I have truly killed him
          - At which point, the authorities pay me
          the bounty.
          (lifting his beer)
          Cheers.
          The two men touch glasses, and take a drink.

                         DJANGO
          What's a bounty?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It's like a reward.

                         DJANGO
          You kill people and they give you a reward?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Certain people, yes.

                         DJANGO
          White people?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mostly. A few Mexicans. Couple Chinamen.

                         DJANGO
          Bad people?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Badder they are, bigger the reward.
          Which brings me to you, and I must admit
          I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes
          to you. On one hand, I despise slavery.
          On the other hand, I need your help,
          and if you're not in a position to refuse,
          all the better. So for the time being,
          I'm going to make this slave malarkey
          work to my benefit.

                         (BEAT)
          Still... . having said that, .I feel guilty.
          So... I'd like the two of us to enter into
          an agreement. I'm looking for The Brittle Brothers,
          however in this endeavor I'm at a slight
          disadvantage, in so far as, I don't know
          what they look like. But you do... .dont'cha?

          BACK TO DJANGO

                         DJANGO
          I know what they look like, all right.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Good. So, here's my agreement. You travel
          with me till we find them -

                         DJANGO
          - Where we goin'?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I hear at least two of them are overseeing
          up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.
          That means we visit every plantation in
          Gatlinburg till we find them. And when we
          find them, you point them out, and I kill
          them. You do that, I agree to give you
          your freedom... . twenty-five dollars per
          Brittle brother - that's seventy-five
          dollars... . your horse, Tony even though
          I've already gave him to you -- but once the
          final Brittle brother lies dead in the
          dust, I'll buy you a new saddle, and a
          new suit of clothes, handsome cowboy hat
          included.
          Dr.Schultz's eyes go to the saloon window.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And as if on cue... . here comes the sheriff.

          EXT - SALOON - MORNING
          We see the sheriff, BILL SHARP, walk towards the saloon cradling a
          Winchester. Some TOWNSPEOPLE (like the Saloon Keeper) stand around to
          watch. A. YOUNG BOY leads a herd of BABY GOATS through town.
          Sheriff Sharp stands in the middle of the street.

                         SHERIFF SHARP
          Okay boys, fun's over, come on out.
          Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch.
          As they do, The Sheriff says;

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         1 2

                         SHERIFF SHARP
          Now why y'all wanna come into my town,
          start trouble, and scare all these nice
          people? You ain't got nothin' better to
          do, then to come into Bill Sharps town
          and show your ass -
          From his top step on the porch, Dr. King Schultz extends his hand
          toward the sheriff, as if to shake it... :.

          .THEN...
          A SMALL DERRINGER - POPS into Schultz's hand from a metal sliding
          apparatus concealed under his jacket sleeve. Once in hand, the dentist
          FIRES one tiny bullet into the belly of Bill Sharp.
          The tiny gun makes a tiny POP sound.
          The shocked Bill Sharp lets out a ugly groan, and doubles over in the
          dirt.
          The TOWNSPEOPLE are startled.
          As is Django.
          As Schultz walks down the porch steps, to the fallen sheriff, reloading
          his tiny pop shooter, a PEDESTRIAN yells out;

                         PEDESTRIAN
          What did you jus' do to our sheriff?
          Dr.Schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law man's
          skull, killing him dead.
          In the background, ONE WOMAN faints. The Boy and his Goats scatter.
          Dr.Schultz looks over at the Saloon Keeper, across the street.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Now you can go get the marshall.

          EXT - DAUGHTREY MAIN STREET - DAY
          U.S.MARSHALL GILL TATUM snaps the MENFOLK OF Daughtrey to attention.

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          Move that buckboard over there long ways
          across the street from the saloon. And I
          want six men and six Winchesters behind it.
          And I want two men with two rifles on this
          roof, and two men with two rifles on that
          roof, with all barrels pointed at that
          front door. And somebody git poor Bill
          outta the goddamn street.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         LP
          Cowboys with rifles climb up stairs to take position on the roof of the
          building across the street from the saloon.
          The Marshall directs the buckboard being moved into place.
          The last SNIPER on the rooftop takes his position.

          WHEN...

          COMING FROM THE SALOON... . PIANO MUSIC ...

          INT - SALOON - DAY
          Dr.Schultz sits behind the piano playing a catchy little saloon number.
          He seems skilled enough to be a professional western saloon piano
          player. A terrified Django, who's sure his new master is a lunatic
          who's going to get them both killed, peeks out the closed curtains
          on the window.
          Dr.Schultz's suit coat sits draped over a chair. All of his weapons,
          including his metal sliding rail Derringer contraption, lie on a table.
          He plays piano in his button down dress shirt and gray suit vest.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What are they doing?

                         DJANGO
          I think they wonderin' why you playin'
          the piana'.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Good.

                         (PAUSE)
          But what are they doing?

                         DJANGO
          A buncha white folks brought a buckboard
          around out front, now they hidin' behind it
          with guns. And a buncha other white folks
          are up on the roof, with rifles pointed
          down here.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Damn, they got that organized fast. Is the
          marshall out there?

                         DJANGO
          If the one I think is the.marshall is the
          marshall, he's out there.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What makes you think he's the marshall?

                         DJANGO
          Cause he's the one ready to say somethin'.

                         MARSHALL'S VOICE
          You in the saloon!
          Dr.Schultz stops playing the piano.

                         MARSHALL'S VOICE
          We got eleven Winchesters on every way
          outta that buildin'! You got once chance
          git outta this alive! You and your nigger
          come out right now with your hands over
          your head, and I mean, right now!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          First things first! Is this the marshall
          I have the pleasure of addressing?

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          Yes it is, this is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Wunderbar! So marshall, I have relieved
          myself of all weapons, and just as you
          have instructed, I'm ready to step outside
          with my hands raised above my head.
          I trust as a representative of the
          criminal justice system of The United
          States of America, I shant be shot down
          in the street, by either you or your deputies,
          before I've had my day in court.

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          You mean like you did our sheriff? Shot
          'em down like a dog in the street!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, that's exactly what I mean! Do I
          have your word as a lawman not to shoot
          me down like a dog in the street?

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          Well, as much as we'd all enjoy seein'
          somethin' like that, ain't nobody gonna
          cheat the hangman in my town!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Fair enough marshall, here we.come.!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Dr.SCHULTZ

                         (TO DJANGO)
          They're a little tense out there. So don't
          make any quick movements, and let me do
          the talking.
          Django looks at him like, "as if..."

          EXT - SALOON/MAIN STREET - DAY
          A lot of guns are trained on the front door of the saloon.
          Outside of range, the WHOLE TOWN watches the stand off.
          The saloon doors open, and Dr.Schultz and Django, hands raised, step
          outside.

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          You unarmed?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes indeed we are. Marshall Tatum, may I
          address you, your deputies, and apparently
          the entire town of Daughtrey, as to the
          incident that just occurred?

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          Go on!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          My name is Dr.King Schultz. And like
          yourself, marshall, I am a servant of the
          court. The man lying dead in the dirt,
          who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit
          to elect as their sheriff, who went by
          the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a
          wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck,
          with a price on his head of two hundred
          dollars. That's two hundred dollars, dead
          or alive.

                         MARSHALL TATUM
          The hell you say!
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'.m aware this is probably disconcerting
          news. But I'm willing to wager this man
          was elected sheriff sometime in the last
          two years. I know this because. three years
          ago he was rustling cattle from,
          The B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company of
          Lubbock Texas.

          Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
          In my possession. is a warrant made out by
          circuit court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk
          of Austin Texas. You are encouraged to wire him.
          He will back up who I am, and who your
          dear departed sheriff was.
          The Menfolk of the town with rifles, begin trading looks. Then
          Dr.Schultz delivers the coup de grace.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          In other words marshall, you owe me
          two hundred dollars.

                         CUT TO

          EXT - TENNESSEE COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
          Django and Dr.Schultz, who by now have ridden quite a few miles
          together, ride their horses in the Tennessee countryside, on the way to
          Gatlinburg. Dr.Schultz is dressed in one of his nearly identical grey
          business suits, and Django is still dressed in his slave pants,
          Schultz's button down dress shirt, and Ace Speck's winter coat.
          Somewhere along the way a pair of shoes have appeared on'his feet.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          One needs a plan, son. These are brutal
          times. A man who survives, is a man with
          a plan. A man who thrives, is a man with
          a good plan. So, having said that, what's
          your plan, young Django?

                         DJANGO
          What'cha mean?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well, after this Brittle business is behind
          us, you'll be a free man, with a horse, and
          seventy five dollars in your back pocket.
          What's your plan after that?

                         DJANGO
          Find my wife, and buy her freedom.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Django, I had no idea you were a married man.
          Do most slaves take the institution of
          matrimony seriously?

                         DJANGO
          Huh?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ZZ
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Do slaves believe in marriage'?

                         DJANGO
          Me and my wife do.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Where is she now?

                         DJANGO
          I dunno. They put us in different boxcars,
          and sent U.S to The Greenville Slave Auction.
          She got sold two days 'fore me.
          But I don't know who to.
          Dr.Schultz takes out a long stick of beef jerky.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Care for some jerky?

                         DJANGO
          Sure.
          Dr.Schultz rips him off a piece. Django chews on it. As he chews,

                         SCHULTZ SAYS;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So your plan is to trackdowri your wife, and
          purchase her.freedom? Only you don't know
          where she is?
          A chewing Django nods his head, yes.
          Dr.Schultz, takes a big bite of jerky, chews for a "moment contemplating
          the dilemma, then pronounces;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well that shouldn't be all that difficult.
          So how long ago did all this happen?

                         DJANGO
          A few months ago.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Three or four?

                         DJANGO
          Three.

          and shewassold at The Greenville Slave
          Auctiontosome :unknown customer three
          monthsago?
          Django nods his head, yes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         Z3
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          The bad part about slavery being a business,
          is it's immoral. The good part about it being
          a business is, they keep records. Somewhere
          in Greenville there's a book with your wife's
          name in it, and the name of the customer who
          bought her, and more then likely their address.
          But then Schultz seems to get second thoughts.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Still, seventy-five dollars in your back
          pocket is a pretty nice grub steak, but it's
          not going to get you very far in Greenville.
          Not to mention a slave auction town in
          Mississippi isn't the safest place you could
          visit. Free or not.

                         DJANGO
          I'll have my freedom papers.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes you will. But say you show them to some
          rascals, and they take them from you and
          tear them up?

                         DJANGO
          They could do that?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm not saying they would, but they could.

                         DJANGO
          They do that I'll kill 'em.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Great! Now you get hung for killin' a white
          man. The point being is the place,is just
          too dangerous for you.

                         DJANGO
          Well I gotta go, when do I go?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          When you get more dangerous.

          Dr.Schultz comes trailing after him.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Django, you have to, it's part of "The Act".
          You're playing a character. Your character
          is The Valet. This is what The Valet wears.
          Remember what I told you. During the act,
          you can never break character.

          EXT - BENNETT MANOR- DAY
          We see Dr. Schultz, riding slightly in front of Django, dressed in his
          blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, as they enter the property of
          BENNETT MANOR, a plantation in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Django leads a
          riderless horse, behind him and Tony.
          As the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front
          steps of Bennett Manor, alongside the cotton fields, all the SLAVES
          stop picking cotton, and straighten their bent backs up to stare in
          wonder at this sight.
          The patriarch of Bennett Manor, SPENCER "BIG DADDY" BENNETT, dressed in
          a fancy leisure suit of the day, emerges from the double doors of the
          mansion, and stands on the top steps, hands on hips, watching the white
          man and black man move from the background to the foreground.
          While there are plenty BLACK MALES out in the cotton fields, the
          majority of the slave population of Bennett Manor is pretty.BLACK
          FEMALES, fourteen to twenty-four, referred to as, "PONY'S".
          The biggest money making crop of this farm, after cotton.
          As Dr.Schultz and fancy pants Django, bring Fritz and Tony to a stop
          in front of Bennett Manor, they've drawn quite a crowd of SLAVES,
          BENNETT FAMILY MEMBERS, and WHITE WORKERS (OVERSEER'S).
          Spencer Bennett keeps on the top step so he won't be forced to look up
          at the darkee on the horse.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          It's against the law for niggers to ride
          horses in this territory.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          This is my valet, and my valet doesn't walk.

                         SPENCER BENNETT

          Not on my.property, around my niggers
          he can't.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          My good sir, perhaps we got off on the
          wrong boot. Allow me to unring this bell.
          My name is Dr.King Schultz, this is my
          valet, Django, and these are our horses,
          Fritz, and Tony.
          Fritz, does his head bow.
          This makes the pretty PONY'S surrounding Bennett, giggle.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr. Bennett, I've been lead to believe you
          are a gentleman, and a business man.
          And it is in these capacities that we've
          ridden from Texas to Tennessee to talk
          with you now.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          State your business.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I wish to purchase one of your
          nigger gals.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to
          Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals,
          no appointment, no nuttin'?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm afraid so.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          Well what if I say, I don't like you, or
          your fancy pants. nigger, and I wouldn't
          sell you a tinkers damn - what'cha gotta
          say about that?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr. Bennett, if you are the business man,
          I've been led to believe you to be,
          I have five thousand things I might say,
          that could change your mind.
          i This gets everybody's attention, not least of all Spencer Bennett.
          Spencer laughs.

          to drink.
          The incognito bounty hunter, dismounts his steed, as does Django.
          Then the good doctor walks up the steps to Bennett Manor.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Maybe while we discuss business, you
          could provide one of your loveliest black
          creatures to escort Django here around
          your magnificent grounds.

                         SPENCER
          Absolutely. Betina!
          A pretty, fleshy, sweet jelled, twenty-two year old slave gal named
          BETINA, snaps to attention.

                         BETINA
          Yes sir, Big Daddy?

                         SPENCER

                         (TO SCHULTZ)
          What's your Jimmies name again?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Django.

                         SPENCER
          Betina sugar, take Django around the
          grounds. Show 'em all the pretty stuff.

                         BETINA
          As you please, Big Daddy.
          Dr.Schultz lowers his voice, and says to the plantation owner;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr. Bennett, I must remind, you, Django is a
          free man. He cannot be treated like a slave.
          Within the bounds of good taste, he must be
          treated as an extension of myself.

                         SPENCER
          Understood., Schultz. Betina?

                         BETINA
          Yes, sir?

                         SPENCER
          Django isn't a slave. Django is a free
          man. Do you understand? You're not to treat
          him like any of these other niggers around
          here, cause he ain't like any of these
          other niggers around here. Ya got it?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         BETINA
          Ya want I should treat 'em like white
          folks?

                         SPENCER
          No that's not what I said.

                         BETINA
          Then I don't know what'cha want Big Daddy.

                         SPENCER
          Yes, I can see that.

                         (HE THINKS)
          What's the name of that peckawood boy from
          town works with the glass? His mama works
          at the lumber yard? He comes by and fixes
          the winda's when we have a problem?
          The MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR chimes in;

          MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR
          Oh, you mean Jerry.

                         SPENCER
          Yeah, that's the boy's name, Jerry.

                         (TO BETINA)
          You know Jerry, dont'cha sugar?

                         BETINA
          Yes 'em, Big Daddy.

                         SPENCER
          Well that's it then... just treat 'em
          like you would Jerry.

          EXT - ANOTHER PART OF BENNETT MANOR - DAY
          Away from the big house, Betina gives Django a tour of the grounds.
          Her in her slave get up, complete with handkerchief on her head, and
          him in his satin baby blue Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, are quite
          the pair. She eyeballs him disapprovingly up and down.

                         BETINA
          What'cha do for your massa'?

                         DJANGO
          Didn't you hear him tell ya, I ain't no slave.

                         BETINA
          So you really free?

                         DJANGO
          Yes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ZY

                         BETINA
          You mean you wanna dress like that?
          Django fumes.

          EXT - BENNETT MANOR (BACK PORCH) - DAY
          Both Spencer Bennett and Dr.Schultz sit on the back porch drinking
          lemonade.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I've been'told by those who should know,
          the most exquisite African flesh in the
          state of Tennessee is bred right here on
          your land. And from the look of these
          black angels, my sources weren't wrong.

                         SPENCER
          Oh I got my share of, coal blacks, horse
          faces, and gummy mouth bitches out in the
          field. But the lion share of my lady
          niggers are real show pony's.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well that's what I'm looking for, a show
          pony for young Django. So the only
          question that remains is, do you have a
          nigger here worth five thousand dollars?

                         SPENCER
          Dr.Schultz, five thousand dollar nigger,
          is practically my middle name.

          BACK TO DJANGO AND BETINA
          Betina and Django walk by a big tree on the plantation grounds.
          The cotton fields and the SLAVES picking it, in the background.

                         DJANGO
          Betina, come over here, I need to ask
          you something.
          He moves her by the tree for more privacy. Betina thinks this fancy
          pants wants to get all lovey-dovey, and she couldn't be less interested.

                         BETINA
          What'cho want?

                         DJANGO
          I'm lookin' for three white men. Three
          brothers. Overseers. Their name is
          Brittle. Do you know 'em?

                         BETINA
          Brittle?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         DJANGO
          Yes, Brittle. John Brittle. Ellis Brittle.
          And Roger Brittle, sometimes called, Little Raj.

                         BETINA
          I don't know dem.

                         DJANGO
          They could be usin' a different name.
          They woulda' come to the plantation in
          the last year.

                         BETINA
          You mean The Shaffer's?

                         DJANGO
          Maybe? Three brother?

                         BETINA
          Ah-huh.

                         DJANGO
          Are they here?

                         BETINA
          Ah-huh.

                         DJANGO
          Can you point one of 'em out to me?

                         BETINA
          Well ones over in that field.
          She points to the cotton field, at a OVERSEER on top of a horse, whip
          in hand, eyeing the blacks at his mercy.
          Django takes hold of a little bag slung over his shoulder opens it, and
          takes out a shiny brass SPYGLASS, the type a sea captain might use.
          Obviously a prop from Dr.Schultz. He slides it open, places it against
          his eye, and points it in the direction of a figure out in the cotton
          field landscape.

                         SPYGLASS POV:
          Astride his nag, the filthy hillbilly, who calls himself SHAFFER, but
          who Django knows to be ELLIS BRITTLE, looks on, oblivious to Django's
          observation.

          DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
          He remembers Ellis Brittle BURNING a "r" into Broomhilda's cheek with a

          BRANDING IRON.

          BACK TO DJANGO AND THE SPYGLASS
          he lowers the glass.

          Is that who you lookin' for?

                         DJANGO
          Yep.
          He folds the spyglass back up, and puts it back in his purse.

                         DJANGO
          Where's the other two?

          BETINA.
          They by the stable, punishin' Little Jody
          for breakin' eggs.

                         DJANGO
          They whippin' Little Jody?
          She nods her head, yes.

                         DJANGO
          Point me in that direction.
          She points to a shed, and keeps pointing right.

                         BETINA
          You go to that shed, and keep goin' that way.
          Which means; "Go to the shed and turn right."

                         DJANGO
          Go git that white man, I came here with.
          He slaps her ass, to hurry her up.
          Then looks to the shed, and begins crossing the distance between him
          and The Brittle Brothers.

                         FLASH ON
          A memory from The Carrucan Plantation; The Brittle Brothers giving his
          wife Broomhilda, a peelin'.
          PEELIN' : A punishment by bullwhip, across the back.
          LITTLE RAJ makes a line in the dirt with the heel of his boot.
          Making Django stand behind it, as he watches his wife being whipped.
          BIG JOHN BRITTLE SLASHES the beauty of Broomhilda's back with his

          BULLWHIP.
          DJANGO, keeping behind the line, begs Big John for mercy.

          Please Big John, she won't do it no more!
          She's real sorry!
          The WHIP RIPS her back.

                         DJANGO

                         (SCREAMING)
          Goddamit, Big John!

                         LITTLE RAJ
          Whoa nigger, calm down, keep it funny.
          Django gets on his knees, and on behalf of Broomhild.a, begs Big John
          Brittle with everything he has.

          BACK TO DJANGO
          crossing the lawn towards The Brittle Brothers, like an express train.

                         FLASH ON
          Big John Brittle standing over him, bullwhip in hand, saying to the

                         KNEELING DJANGO;

          BIG JOHN BRITTLE
          I like the way you beg, boy.

          Little Raj Brittle, ties LITTLE JODY, a petite slave girl (eighteen)
          to a dead tree stump.
          BIG JOHN BRITTLE paces, taking a few practice CRACKS with his WHIP.
          LITTLE JODY begs The Shaffer Brothers/The Brittle Brothers for mercy.
          ROGER goes and sits on a old wagon wheel to watch the whippin'.

          BIG JOHN BRITTLE
          Now Jody quit your caterwaulin'. You know
          yourself it's for your own good. Niggers
          are clumsy. You'd break everything in
          goddamn sight, you weren't cured. And the
          only known cure for nigger clumsiness
          is a peelin'.
          Little Jody begs to differ.

          BACK TO DJANGO
          As Django in his powder blue satin suit hurries across the grass to
          Little Jody and The Brittle Brothers, he collects eight little friends
          who happily run along with the fast walking man. EIGHT LITTLE FRENCH
          BULLDOGS who bark, yelp, snort and breath at his heels.. Django pays the
          little dogs no nevermind.
